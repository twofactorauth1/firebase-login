You must not describe or assign keywords to your blog in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Indigenous may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Indigenous liability. You must immediately notify Indigenous of any unauthorized uses of your blog, your account or any other breaches of security. Indigenous will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. 2.7 Responsibility of Contributors.  If you operate a blog, comment on a blog, post material to the Site, post links on the Site, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Site (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that your content does not violate these terms or the Acceptable Use Policy. By submitting Content to Indigenous for inclusion on your Site, you grant Indigenous a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, and promoting your blog. This license allows Indigenous to make publicly-posted content available to third parties selected by Indigenous so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) your content through their services. You also give other Indigenous users permission to share your Content on other Indigenous Sites and add their own Content to it (aka to reblog your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your site. If you delete Content, Indigenous will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Site, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Indigenous has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Indigenous’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Indigenous’s reasonable opinion, violates any Indigenous policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Site to any individual or entity for any reason, in Indigenous’s sole discretion. Indigenous will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid. 2.8 Responsibility of Website Visitors. Indigenous has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Site, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Site, Indigenous does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Site may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Site may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. Indigenous disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Site, or from any downloading by those visitors of content there posted. 2.9 Content Posted on Other Sites. We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites and webpages to which Indigenous links and that link to Indigenous. Indigenous does not have any control over those non-Indigenous websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Indigenous website or webpage, Indigenous does not represent or imply that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Indigenous disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-Indigenous websites and webpages. 2.10 Domain Names. If you are registering a domain name, using or transferring a previously registered domain name, you acknowledge and agree that use of the domain name is also subject to the policies of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) and the Domain Name Registration and Customer Service Agreement. 3. FEES 3.1 Fees. The fees for the Subscription Service and any additional Services ("Fees") are set forth in the Order Form and are payable in advance, irrevocable and non-refundable except as set forth in the Order Form and this Agreement. You agree to provide Indigenous with complete and accurate billing and contact information. Where payment by credit card is indicated in the Order Form, or You otherwise provide Indigenous with credit card information, You authorize Indigenous to bill such credit card (a) at the time that You order the Indigenous Service or other Services set forth in the Order Form, (b) for any billing frequency otherwise established in the Order Form, and (c) at the time of any renewal, for the amount charged plus any applicable sales taxes for any renewed Subscription Term. If Indigenous, in its discretion, permits You to make payment using a method other than a credit card, Indigenous will invoice You at the time of the initial Order Form and thereafter on a monthly basis in advance of the relevant billing period, and all such amounts invoiced will be due within ten (10) days of Your receipt of Indigenous's invoice. Late payments shall be subject to a service charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum charge permitted by law, whichever is less. 3.2 Taxes. You shall pay all personal property, sales, use, value-added, withholding and similar taxes (other than taxes on Indigenous's net income) arising from the transactions described in this Agreement, even if such amounts are not listed on an Order Form. To the extent You are exempt from sales or other taxes, You agree to provide Indigenous, upon request, with the appropriate exemption certificate. 3.3 Non-Payment; Other Suspension Rights. Indigenous may terminate the Indigenous Service if the billing or contact information provided by You is false or fraudulent. Indigenous also reserves the right, in its discretion, to suspend Your access and/or use of the Indigenous Service: (i) where any payment is due but unpaid and You have been requested but failed to promptly cure such payment failure; or (ii) in the event a dispute arises on Your account as to who at Your business has authority to act or manage Your account and Indigenous is not promptly provided with written instructions from the interested parties associated with Your account that fully resolves the dispute. You acknowledge and agree that it a dispute arises as to management of Your account, then (i) if the listed owner of the account is a corporation, limited liability company or other registered entity, Indigenous may rely on public records (to the extent available) concerning the appropriate authorized executives or managers of Your entity; or (ii) if the listed owner is a dba or sole proprietorship, or any other entity for which public records of control are not readily accessible online, Indigenous may assume that the person or entity that has been making payments on Your account has the authority to manage the account. You agree that Indigenous shall not be liable to You nor to any third party for any suspension of the Indigenous Service resulting from Your non-payment of Fees or from a dispute as to the management rights to Your account. 4. CONFIDENTIALITY; USE OF NAMES 4.1 Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, confidential information shall include the business terms in the Order Form, Your Data, the Indigenous Service and the Indigenous Materials, and any information that is clearly identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be confidential by the receiving party given the nature of the information and the circumstances of its disclosure ("Confidential Information"). Each party agrees: (a) to receive and maintain in confidence all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party or by a third-party; (b) not to use the Confidential Information of the other party except to the extent necessary to perform its obligations or exercise rights hereunder; (c) to limit the internal dissemination of Confidential Information to those employees and contractors of the recipient who have a need to know and an obligation to protect it; and (d) to protect the confidentiality thereof in the same manner as it protects the confidentiality of similar information and data of its own (at all times exercising at least a reasonable degree of care in the protection of such Confidential Information). Indigenous will restrict its employees' access to Your Confidential Information to only those employees necessary to successfully provide the Indigenous Service. Indigenous may disclose Confidential Information on a need-to-know basis to its contractors who have executed written agreements requiring them to maintain such information in strict confidence and use it only to facilitate the performance of their services for Indigenous in connection with the performance of this Agreement. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (1) is known publicly; (2) is generally known in the industry before disclosure; (3) has become known publicly, without fault of the recipient, subsequent to disclosure by the disclosing party; or (4) the recipient becomes aware of from a third party not bound by non-disclosure obligations to the disclosing party and with the lawful right to disclose such information to the recipient. This Section will not be construed to prohibit the disclosure of Confidential Information to the extent that such disclosure is required by law or order of a court or other governmental authority. The parties agree to give the other party prompt notice of the receipt of any subpoena or other similar request for such disclosure. 4.2 Credit Card Information. Indigenous agrees that it will retain and store any provided credit card information only for the minimum amount of time required for business, legal and/or regulatory purposes, and will use standard industry practices to protect such information from unauthorized access, disclosure or use. 4.3 Use of Names in Marketing. You may use Indigenous's name and credentials in an appropriate and acceptable manner for Your standard marketing promotions, provided that You agree to cease or alter such use at Indigenous's request where such use is contrary to Indigenous's branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to Indigenous. Similarly, Indigenous may use Your business name in an appropriate and acceptable manner for standard marketing promotions, provided that Indigenous agrees to cease or alter such use at Your request where such use is contrary to Your branding policies, could cause any brand confusion in the market or is otherwise objectionable to You. Acceptable and standard marketing promotions include, but are not limited to: client listings, press releases, surveys, interviews, reputable business publications, television, and web site presentation and promotion, etc. 5. TERM & TERMINATION 5.1 Standard Term. Unless a different Term is specified in a signed Order Form between You and Indigenous, the Initial Term of Your subscription to an Indigenous Service will begin on the submission or execution of Your Order Form and shall continue on a month to basis until the subscription is terminated as provided for in this Article 5. The term of this Agreement will automatically terminate when all active Subscription Terms have been terminated. 5.2 Termination without Cause. Either party may terminate the Subscription Term to an Indigenous Service by providing thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other party. Indigenous's termination rights are in addition to any suspension rights it may have under this Agreement or the incorporated Acceptable Use Policy. 5.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination of the Subscription Term, all Fees then due and payable to Indigenous must be paid in full. Contingent upon its receipt of all such Fees, Indigenous will continue to make Your Data available for downloading through the termination date. In addition, for a period of thirty (30) days following termination, You may arrange for the downloading of Your Data by contacting Indigenous. Following this (30) day grace period, Indigenous may remove Your Data from the production environment for the Indigenous Service. The provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination shall survive, including but not limited to obligations concerning confidentiality, protection of intellectual property, indemnification and payment of unpaid Fees and expenses. 6. WARRANTIES/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY/INDEMNITY 6.1 Limited Warranties. Indigenous warrants for a period of thirty (30) days following their delivery that all professional Services provided hereunder will be performed in a workmanlike manner, in conformity with the professional standards for comparable services in the industry. For any breach of this warranty timely reported by You, Your exclusive remedy shall be the re-performance of the deficient Services, and if Indigenous is unable to re-perform the deficient Services as warranted, You shall be entitled to recover the portion of the Fees paid to Indigenous for such deficient Services, and such refund shall be Indigenous's entire liability. You warrant that Your business shall, at all times, comply with, and shall remain solely responsible for compliance with, all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the Indigenous Acceptable Use Policy, in connection with Your use of the Indigenous Service, and You agree to indemnify and hold Indigenous harmless from and against any third party or government claims, including all related damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), that arise due to Your violation of law or breach of this warranty in Your use of the Indigenous Service. 6.2 Indigenous Not Responsible for Third Party Content. The Indigenous Service may be bundled by third parties (including but not limited to Indigenous marketing or content partners) with Third Party Content designed to facilitate use of the Indigenous Service in certain market niches or to customize the Indigenous Service for use by certain categories of target customers. To the extent that You either purchase the Indigenous Service from such third parties or acquire the Third Party Content or configuration services from such third parties (even though you may purchase the core Indigenous Service directly from Indigenous), Indigenous does not warrant in any manner and will not be responsible for such Third Party Content and You agree to look solely to the relevant third party provider (and not Indigenous) if and to the extent that you have any complaints or issues relating to the Third Party Content or its interaction with an Indigenous Service. 6.3 Warranty Disclaimers. EACH PARTY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, UNINTERRUPTED SERVICE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INDIGENOUS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE INDIGENOUS SERVICE. 6.4 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL INDIGENOUS BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
